description = "This course is an advanced, content-enhanced Korean class that takes students beyond textbooks into real-life language use. Through authentic materials—such as essays, poems, songs, news articles, films, advertisements, webtoons, and speeches—students explore the intersections of language and society, examining how Korean reflects and shapes identity, values, and social change. Class activities combine performance-based tasks with real-life applications: students debate contemporary issues, engage in cross-cultural discussions with peers in Korea, and practice advanced communication strategies for academic and professional contexts. By integrating language study with cultural and social analysis, the course builds advanced proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening, while preparing students to use Korean effectively in authentic, real-world situations. The course is taught in Korean and may be retaken as themes rotate."
