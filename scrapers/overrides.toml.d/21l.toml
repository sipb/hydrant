name = "The Art of War and Peace: Problems in Cultural Interpretation"
description = "Barring natural catastrophes, the single most important factor enhancing human flourishing has been a society’s ability to conduct war with other means: diplomacy. This closely connects the arts of war to the arts of peace. Over the past two centuries Western European and American hegemony have globally enforced the “Westphalian system” of diplomacy, which relies on principles of the equal sovereignty of states, contractual obligations, and coalition-building. Yet, this system is currently failing in the face of strongman politics, world order polarization, mass migration, deep-rooted ethnic conflict, climate injustice, and gross inequality. How can we remake our diplomatic order in the service of collective human flourishing? And what diplomatic models across world history have encouraged the art of peace-making?\n\nWe explore this question through six modules. First, we take stock of our historical moment, examining the roots of today’s Westphalian world order and of the current failure of diplomacy. Next, we build our conceptual toolbox by reading strategy classics for War & Peace, including Sunzi’s Art of War, Kautilya’s Treatise on Statecraft, Machiavelli’s The Prince, Napoleon’s Military Maxims, Joseph Nye on soft power and more. We then explore different diplomatic systems across world history through historical and literary texts, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean diplomatic poetry, Ferdowsi’s Shahnahme. The Book of Kings, Luo Guanzhong’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This prepares us to become creative, critical and constructive in our last three modules. We will play games of diplomacy with experts from the MIT Game Lab and work through the K-Drama Queen Seondeok to create a theory of K-drama diplomatics. These two modules help us assess how our media culture primes us for success—or failure—of peace-making and human flourishing and will inspire us to reflect on how to design diplomacy games and TV series that prime us for better diplomacy. The class reaches its highpoint with a “New Diplomacy Summit,” where students present their final projects—strategies and tools for building a better world through better diplomacy. We can test our ideas against  the real world in a final zoom meeting with diplomats and policy-makers associated with the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator."
