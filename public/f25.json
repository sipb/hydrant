Therefore, addressing carbon emissions in cities is crucial for global efforts to combat climate change. In an urban social carbon economy, the course will focus on efforts to reduce carbon emissions and will explore methodologies to design solutions with a focus on social equity, community well-being, and inclusive development within urban contexts. \n\nThe course examines the intersections that enable individuals, communities, institutions, and corporations to take action by actively measuring, monitoring, and reducing their carbon emissions. By deepening in the understanding of the power of Artificial Intelligence and behavior change, which has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by one-third globally, the new carbon economy will create opportunities to accelerate the net-zero goals across all industries.

Urban areas are significant contributors to carbon emissions due to factors like transportation, industry, and energy consumption. Therefore, addressing carbon emissions in cities is crucial for global efforts to combat climate change. In an urban social carbon economy, the course will focus on efforts to reduce carbon emissions and will explore methodologies to design solutions with a focus on social equity, community well-being, and inclusive development within urban contexts. \n\nThe course examines the intersections that enable individuals, communities, institutions, and corporations to take action by actively measuring, monitoring, and reducing their carbon emissions. By deepening in the understanding of the power of Artificial Intelligence and behavior change, which has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by one-third globally, the new carbon economy will create opportunities to accelerate the net-zero goals across all industries. Students will deepen their understanding of carbon avoidance and reduction products and infrastructure that leverage existing and new technologies like AI, sensor fusion, gamification, blockchain, and incentive systems that will power the new economy.","name":"Social Carbon Economy","inCharge":"Ramiro Almeida, Ryan Chin","virtualStatus":false,"rating":6.6,"hours":3.6,"size":13.0,"nonext":false,"repeat":true,"url":"","final":false,"half":false,"limited":false,"new":false},"10.965":{"number":"10.965","course":"10","subject":"965","terms":["FA","SP"],"prereqs":"''Permission of instructor''","sectionKinds":["lecture"],"lectureRawSections":["76-258/T/0/9-11"],"lectureSections":[[[[40,4]],"76-258"]],"tba":false,"hassH":false,"hassA":false,"hassS":false,"hassE":false,"cih":false,"cihw":false,"rest":false,"lab":false,"partLab":false,"lectureUnits":2,"labUnits":0,"preparationUnits":4,"level":"G","isVariableUnits":false,"same":"","meets":"","description":"Advanced topics on the state-of-the-art in design and implementation of analytical processes for biological systems, including single-cell analysis, micro/nanotechnologies, systems biology, biomanufacturing, and process engineering.

Students examine engineering case studies alongside key readings by foundational ethical thinkers from Aristotle to Martin Luther King, Jr., and investigate which ethical approaches are best and how to apply them. Topics include justice, rights, cost-benefit analysis, safety, bias, genetic engineering, climate change, and the promise and peril of AI. Discussion-based, with the aim of introducing students to new ways of thinking. All sections cover the same core ethical frameworks, but some sections have a particular focus for case studies, such as bioengineering, or have an in-depth emphasis on particular thinkers. The subject is taught in separate sections. Students are eligible to take any section regardless of their registered subject number. For 20.005, students additionally undertake an ethical-technical analysis of a BE-related topic of their choosing.","name":"Ethics for Engineers","inCharge":"Fall: B. L. Trout,  P. Hansen, D.
