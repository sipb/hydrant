# Subject overrides

Files added here will only override subjects scraped from the catalog and Fireroad. See [`override-schema.json`](./override-schema.json) to see what format to write overrides in.

If an `include.txt` file is in this or either the `presem` or `sem` subdirectory, this is used for requiring a class to appear in Hydrant despite it not being in the Registrar's subject listing. Here, list every class on a separate line.
