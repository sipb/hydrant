To initiate this course, students will select a building threshold from a project that they have previously designed and use it as a basis to produce 5-10 new threshold variations. The threshold variations will be a detailed response and study of select architectural precedents. For the final project, students will select one threshold design to build a physical model at full (or half) scale.\n\nStudents will explore the design potential of building thresholds, passages, and openings. Every threshold is on the verge of\u2013. Choosing and isolating a threshold allows for an in-depth study of the passage between interiors, and exteriors, and of the in between space itself. For example, in Marcel Duchamp\u2019s door 11 rue Larrey from 1927, the threshold is an opening to, a closure of, and as such it holds the space between both conditions.\n\nIn their threshold (re)designs, students will explore multiple threshold design options\u2013each approached through a different tectonic lens. The variations will be supported by two studies: 1. an exploration of a range of cross-cultural threshold precedents drawn from editions of GA Detail, Global Architecture, El Croquis, and when possible, detailed vernacular and classical examples to establish the tectonic lenses; 2. An exploration of material, spatial, and atmospheric properties and qualities, and the bodily performances required of the passage.\n\nThe approach to tectonic studies is informed by a range of precedents from literature, mathematics, art, music and architecture. In art and music, instructional compositions are informed by repetition, variation, and singularity (uniqueness). Examples are the chance compositions of John Cage and the wall drawings of Sol Le Witt. Other models for this exploration include Elements of Style by Raymond Queneau and 99 Variations on a Proof by Philip Ording, two works that begin with a simple premise that is reinvented one hundredfold by a new set of principles, techniques, contexts, and histories.\n\nQueneau the cofounder of OuLiPo (workshop of potential literature) begins with a narrative, while Ording begins with a theorem, yet each uses the same method to generate new perspectives of the original through an exploration of style. The class will draw from these examples to devise constraints and rules to conceive of and structure thresholds.\n\nSince the threshold selected by student is from an original design that was given much consideration previously, each new speculation suggests alternative design approaches and potentials for the original building design, and, for their future approach to design in general.", "name": "Special Subject: Design \u2014 Architecture & Thresholds", "inCharge": "Y.

The program has two primary areas of emphasis:\n\n1. Peer mentoring. You will be an undergraduate lab assistant for 2.007. This will require signing-on to a regularly scheduled 2.007 lab section and an additional three-hour lab block, to assist 2.007 students with fabrication, including machining, hand-tool use, materials and supplies assistance, brainstorming, and general peer-to-peer support.\n\n2. Project work.Apprentices will participate in a series of seminars and clinics to refresh and further their fabrication knowledge and hands-on skills, including mill and lathe use, CAD/CAM, patternmaking, and casting (for senior project). Weekly seminars and practicum cover a variety of topics such as shop best practices, machine setup, chip formation, fixturing, material selection, and physical metallurgy. Junior apprentices will fabricate a Stirling engine and returning senior apprentices will focus on copper alloys, continuing to fabricate a replica of an 1899 anchor windlass from the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company, used on the famous New York 70 class sloops. Lab use for project work will be scheduled around 2.007 and requires apprentices to be largely self-directed.\n\nThis is a limited enrollment course, and students are encouraged to apply by sending resume and portfolio to pappalardolab@mit.edu, by midnight, December 31, 2023, with subject line \u201cPappalardo Lab Apprentice Application\u201d.
