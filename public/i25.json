At what scale is infrastructure an appropriate response to an environmental problem? How does one evaluate effectiveness and other trade-offs / costs / benefits of resiliency? Can one build consensus among key players / constituents around what is happening and how the designed response addresses needs?

Subsidiary questions include: what can data do, and what can\u2019t it do? What do practitioners need to know about the data now available: where does it come from? How is it generated? Who owns it? How can it be used for decision-making? What skills are needed? What do different segments of society \u2013 the public sector, the private sector, individual travelers \u2013 need to do? What are the challenges? What can be learned from history, and from other disciplines?\n\nThis course is designed to slot in between existing course offerings that cover technical topics (like data analysis, modeling, visualization, and optimization) and equity/social-justice issues, providing students an opportunity to develop their own understanding of transportation data and its applications, so that they can give full consideration to the technical and social approaches covered in other classes.\n\nA single focus question will be presented as the basis for the course\u2019s primary case study: how many transportation fatalities occurred in the U.S. in 2022? This will require not simple data crunching, but thoughtful \u201chuman\u201d analysis using questions such as those above, since the point of the course is to demonstrate that there is no single, authoritative answer, and that students\u2019 critical application of understanding the entire data lifecycle is key to approaching professional challenges.","name":"Transportation Data & Applications","inCharge":"Fall: J.

How can translations, good and bad, productively challenge an idea\u2019s core?\n\nPart visual language study/seminar, part workshop, this class will examine translation as method and practice for visual experimentation. The course will start by examining typographic printing history, where students will gain knowledge of the various technological precedents for fixing forms of language. Students can also expect to experiment with calligraphic form, modular alphabets, notational conventions, musical transposition, and image-to-text as well as text-to-image translations. These experiments will be supplemented with guest visits from artists, writers, and technologists, as well as references of theoretical writings from Walter Benjamin, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Donald Knuth, Louis L\u00fcthi, Hito Steyerl, Byung-Chul Han, \u00c9douard Glissant, and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, among others.

Current applications are wide-ranging and include biological imaging, quantum optical technologies, chemical sensing, and precision measurements of time and distance among many others. During this IAP course, we will cover the essentials of ultrafast photonics. Topics will include: (1) the science of ultrafast laser pulses and their interaction with matter; (2) the technology to generate and manipulate ultrafast pulses of light; and (3) an overview of select applications of ultrafast photonics systems. This course will serve as a foundation for those interested in experimental and/or theoretical work involving ultrafast optical systems.
