description = "Explores moral, political, and computational foundations of AI alignment. Draws on political theory and computer science to consider how individual and collective values are elicited and embedded in AI. Topics include bureaucracy-based versus AI-based decision rules; the concept of values; fairness and welfare objectives; pluralism and democratic input; and how well technical elicitation methods can capture considered judgments. Activities include seminar discussion, periodic problem sets, short response papers, and a course research project."

Or that time pressure decreases your creative problem solving by 45%? Thriving in life, work, and school isn't a mystery-it’s within your grasp. Research shows that nearly half of your well-being is shaped by your daily choices. In Hack Yourself, you’ll learn how to design those choices, building a toolkit of over 60 sustainable positive habits. You’ll apply a data science approach to how you live and lead-using tools from generative AI to vibe coding to statistical analysis to validate and personalize positive psychology practices, while also applying the same data methods across domains from leadership to innovation. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided. Students complete a group project in the last ¼ of the course."
