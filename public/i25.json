At what scale is infrastructure an appropriate response to an environmental problem? How does one evaluate effectiveness and other trade-offs / costs / benefits of resiliency?

How can it be used for decision-making? What skills are needed? What do different segments of society \u2013 the public sector, the private sector, individual travelers \u2013 need to do? What are the challenges? What can be learned from history, and from other disciplines?\n\nThis course is designed to slot in between existing course offerings that cover technical topics (like data analysis, modeling, visualization, and optimization) and equity/social-justice issues, providing students an opportunity to develop their own understanding of transportation data and its applications, so that they can give full consideration to the technical and social approaches covered in other classes.\n\nA single focus question will be presented as the basis for the course\u2019s primary case study: how many transportation fatalities occurred in the U.S. in 2022?
