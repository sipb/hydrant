This closely connects the arts of war to the arts of peace. Over the past two centuries Western European and American hegemony have globally enforced the \u201cWestphalian system\u201d of diplomacy, which relies on principles of the equal sovereignty of states, contractual obligations, and coalition-building. Yet, this system is currently failing in the face of strongman politics, world order polarization, mass migration, deep-rooted ethnic conflict, climate injustice, and gross inequality. How can we remake our diplomatic order in the service of collective human flourishing? And what diplomatic models across world history have encouraged the art of peace-making?\n\nWe explore this question through six modules. First, we take stock of our historical moment, examining the roots of today\u2019s Westphalian world order and of the current failure of diplomacy. Next, we build our conceptual toolbox by reading strategy classics for War & Peace, including Sunzi\u2019s Art of War, Kautilya\u2019s Treatise on Statecraft, Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince, Napoleon\u2019s Military Maxims, Joseph Nye on soft power and more. We then explore different diplomatic systems across world history through historical and literary texts, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean diplomatic poetry, Ferdowsi\u2019s Shahnahme. The Book of Kings, Luo Guanzhong\u2019s Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This prepares us to become creative, critical and constructive in our last three modules. We will play games of diplomacy with experts from the MIT Game Lab and work through the K-Drama Queen Seondeok to create a theory of K-drama diplomatics. These two modules help us assess how our media culture primes us for success\u2014or failure\u2014of peace-making and human flourishing and will inspire us to reflect on how to design diplomacy games and TV series that prime us for better diplomacy. The class reaches its highpoint with a \u201cNew Diplomacy Summit,\u201d where students present their final projects\u2014strategies and tools for building a better world through better diplomacy.

By deepening in the understanding of the power of Artificial Intelligence and behavior change, which has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by one-third globally, the new carbon economy will create opportunities to accelerate the net-zero goals across all industries.
