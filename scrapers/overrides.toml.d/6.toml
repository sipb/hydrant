Each week, we will cover algorithmic techniques and practice coding challenges, with an emphasis on problem-solving. Class format will be a lecture followed by problem-solving sessions. Days will alternate between beginner and advanced lectures on the same topic. Beginner lectures are designed for students without any prior algorithmic knowledge, while advanced lectures are designed for students who are confident in the beginner lecture material. Problem-solving sessions will contain both beginner and advanced problems, designed for students of all levels. Lectures and problem sessions will cover ideas and skills not practiced in Course 6 classes such as 6.1010 and 6.1210.'''

The Art and Science of PCB Design is an introductory course into the fundamental aspects of developing electronic systems on printed circuit boards (PCBs). This course will heavily focus on providing hands-on labs with electronic design tools actively used in industry towards designing a primary course project resulting with the physical assembly of a PCB-based device. Students will gain experience in designing systems, conducting SPICE simulations, drawing schematics, and creating a PCB layout. Complexed topics in electrical and PCB design will be explored, including from guest speakers and through advanced simulations. This class is intended for students of all skill-levels but at a minimum requires a basic understanding of circuit analysis, which will be applied towards learning how to implement real devices.

Prerequisites: Understanding of basic circuit analysis provided in 6.200, 2.678, or equivalent. Prospective students who have not taken 6.200, 2.678, or an equivalent class will be required to pass a staff-created open-book pretest, prior to the start of IAP, that covers required circuit knowledge for the course.

6.S095 is a survey of problem solving techniques in probability, random variables, and stochastic processes. It picks up from a standard introduction to the subject and goes towards more advanced techniques. The first half of 6.S095 reviews standard concepts in probability while introducing much more involved applications of these topics, while the second half will introduce adjacent areas of exploration. The aim of this class is to develop problem solving ability and mathematical maturity that will enable students to succeed in advanced and graduate-level EECS classes that involve probability such as 6.1220 (6.046), 6.7710 (6.262), 6.7720 (6.265), 6.7800 (6.437), 6.7810 (6.438), and 6.5220 (6.856).

The class runs in two tracks: a standard track that has greater focus on problem solving in fundamental probability concepts, and an advanced track that solidifies problem solving skills in more advanced probability techniques. Each track will have 7 lectures, each with a corresponding recitation and problem set.'''
