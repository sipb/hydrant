name = 'Theater Arts Production: Antigonick'
description = "In this hands-on studio course, students collaborate in all aspects of staging Antigonick, a contemporary, visual adaptation of Sophocles’ Antigone by Anne Carson, with evocative illustrations by Bianca Stone. The play asks how we live through loss, and how individuals navigate tensions between deeply held values, processes of the natural world, and the laws of the state. Opportunities abound for students to engage in myriad ways – as actors, designers, assistant stage managers, musicians, dancers, and technicians. All are encouraged to enroll, and all experience levels are welcome! The production course will be co-taught by actor and director Blythe de Oliveira Foster and designer Sara Brown. MIT students will receive 12 credits, HASS-A."

name = "Advanced Topics in Theater Arts: Dancing with Cameras"
description = "In Dancing with Cameras we will learn skills for planning, filming and creating your own dance films, or screendances. The form is a hybrid of the various techniques of film/video and the practice of choreography. Participants will be encouraged to use items they have available to them including smartphones or a DSLR camera, and free or non-free editing software. No dance experience is required though you will move and become the subjects in each other’s films! During the course we will make multiple studies and one-minute films culminating in longer final projects to be presented in our mini dance film festival at the end of the semester. We will watch screendances, learn about the history of the genre, and experiment with forming unique cinematic voices."
