name = "Special Seminar in EAPS-Exploring Solar System Surfaces (No Spacesuit Required)"
description = "Investigates the diverse surfaces of planetary bodies throughout our Solar System through the lens of remote sensing and robotic exploration. Examines how mission data reveals the formation, evolution, and current state of rocky planets, icy moons, and small bodies. Compares and contrasts geological processes across different planetary environments, from Mercury's extreme temperature variations to the subsurface oceans of Europa and Enceladus. Topics may include impact cratering; volcanism; tectonics; weathering and erosion processes; sedimentary deposits; glacial and periglacial features; and the search for habitable environments. Analyzes datasets of planetary surfaces from past and current missions (Cassini, New Horizons, OSIRIS-REx, Mars rovers, and more) alongside recent scientific literature. Emphasizes critical reading, student-led discussions, and comparative planetology approaches, with a component of hypothesis-driven mission concepts driven by current scientific advances."
