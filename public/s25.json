What road are you embarking upon in starting a company, and what obstacles threaten your success? What is the core problem you\u2019re solving? What else and who else will you need? If you\u2019re thinking about starting a company, this class will enable you to learn by doing. You will solve real-life hardware startup problems, with the help of mentors and leaders from the Boston tech ecosystem. Topics you\u2019ll explore include: challenges related to intellectual property negotiations with large incumbents; servicing equipment out in the wild; finding product-market fit; resolving manufacturing and quality issues; scaling up; and reaching strong gross margins. You\u2019ll hear from guest speakers who will share their experiences \u2013 successful and unsuccessful \u2013 traveling this rocky path with its moments of crisis and triumph.\n\nAlthough we will cover the basics of new venture creation, this is not a class about writing a business plan. Rather it\u2019s about grasping the essence of the journey you\u2019re about to undertake, and understanding the mindset required to be an entrepreneur developing a mechanical product. You will learn critical thinking skills that will help you assess the viability of a particular technology before you spend the years required to build a physical product. This class provides an exploration of leadership, innovation, and creativity as seen through the lens of a mechanical tech startup founder. You will gain broad insight into what\u2019s required to turn a novel vision into a useful product.","name":"Founder's Journey: Launching and Scaling Hardware Startups","inCharge":"K.

Linking social theory, geography, public policy and planning history, this course asks: How can planners and critical observers of the built environment begin to access the collection of meanings that script the movement, stasis and location of everyday users? In other words, how do we move beyond official maps, plans and histories to consider contested meanings of place as they are lived, exchanged and created. Through weekly examinations of first person documentary accounts including ethnography, historical fiction, autobiography, film and novels, students will analyze the social, political and geographic impact of various land development strategies in the U.S. and beyond. Displacement defines a major theme of this course -- students will examine: 1) How does this happen? 2) What have been subsequent local responses? And, 3) What are the lasting consequences of population dispersals?\n\nInformed by ethnographic method and archival immersion, this course will provide students with an interdisciplinary framework for identifying and describing the social impact of place-based change and capital movement. Students will develop a critical understanding of urban planning informed by resident-authored analysis across time and space.","name":"(Un)Dead Geographies: The Afterlife of Urban Plans","inCharge":"Fall: R.

To initiate this course, students will select a building threshold from a project that they have previously designed and use it as a basis to produce 5-10 new threshold variations. The threshold variations will be a detailed response and study of select architectural precedents. For the final project, students will select one threshold design to build a physical model at full (or half) scale.\n\nStudents will explore the design potential of building thresholds, passages, and openings. Every threshold is on the verge of\u2013. Choosing and isolating a threshold allows for an in-depth study of the passage between interiors, and exteriors, and of the in between space itself. For example, in Marcel Duchamp\u2019s door 11 rue Larrey from 1927, the threshold is an opening to, a closure of, and as such it holds the space between both conditions.\n\nIn their threshold (re)designs, students will explore multiple threshold design options\u2013each approached through a different tectonic lens. The variations will be supported by two studies: 1. an exploration of a range of cross-cultural threshold precedents drawn from editions of GA Detail, Global Architecture, El Croquis, and when possible, detailed vernacular and classical examples to establish the tectonic lenses; 2. An exploration of material, spatial, and atmospheric properties and qualities, and the bodily performances required of the passage.\n\nThe approach to tectonic studies is informed by a range of precedents from literature, mathematics, art, music and architecture. In art and music, instructional compositions are informed by repetition, variation, and singularity (uniqueness). Examples are the chance compositions of John Cage and the wall drawings of Sol Le Witt. Other models for this exploration include Elements of Style by Raymond Queneau and 99 Variations on a Proof by Philip Ording, two works that begin with a simple premise that is reinvented one hundredfold by a new set of principles, techniques, contexts, and histories.\n\nQueneau the cofounder of OuLiPo (workshop of potential literature) begins with a narrative, while Ording begins with a theorem, yet each uses the same method to generate new perspectives of the original through an exploration of style. The class will draw from these examples to devise constraints and rules to conceive of and structure thresholds.\n\nSince the threshold selected by student is from an original design that was given much consideration previously, each new speculation suggests alternative design approaches and potentials for the original building design, and, for their future approach to design in general.","name":"Special Subject: Design \u2014 Architecture & Thresholds","inCharge":"Y.

Our objective is to push the boundaries of the lab experience, further developing your skills and the workspace as one of the safest, most productive, positive, and creative labs on campus. The program has two primary areas of emphasis:\n\n1. Peer mentoring. You will be an undergraduate lab assistant for 2.007. This will require signing-on to a regularly scheduled 2.007 lab section and an additional three-hour lab block, to assist 2.007 students with fabrication, including machining, hand-tool use, materials and supplies assistance, brainstorming, and general peer-to-peer support.\n\n2. Project work.Apprentices will participate in a series of seminars and clinics to refresh and further their fabrication knowledge and hands-on skills, including mill and lathe use, CAD/CAM, patternmaking, and casting (for senior project). Weekly seminars and practicum cover a variety of topics such as shop best practices, machine setup, chip formation, fixturing, material selection, and physical metallurgy. Junior apprentices will fabricate a Stirling engine and returning senior apprentices will focus on copper alloys, continuing to fabricate a replica of an 1899 anchor windlass from the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company, used on the famous New York 70 class sloops. Lab use for project work will be scheduled around 2.007 and requires apprentices to be largely self-directed.\n\nThis is a limited enrollment course, and students are encouraged to apply by sending resume and portfolio to pappalardolab@mit.edu, by midnight, December 31, 2023, with subject line \u201cPappalardo Lab Apprentice Application\u201d.
