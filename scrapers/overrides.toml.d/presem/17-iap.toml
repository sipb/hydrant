name = "Politics of the Modern Middle East"
description = "This course will provide an in-depth, nuanced understanding of the politics of the modern Middle East, from World War I to today. Media coverage of the Middle East increases by the day, but knowledge of the region and its politics remain in short supply. Why has the Middle East seemingly experienced so much conflict? How do ethnic and religious identities, domestic politics, and the balance of power between nations help explain state behavior in the region? What explains variation in the political and economic situation of the people living in different areas across the Middle East? Why has authoritarianism endured and democracy been in short supply? The course will focus on the politics of key states in the region to which MIT students may travel for internships, including Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)."
